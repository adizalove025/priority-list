[![Priority List](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/iterative/priority-list/weekly.yml?label=action&logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/iterative/priority-list/actions/workflows/weekly.yml)

Make a dent in GitHub issue & PR backlogs across repositories.

Aimed at teams managing multiple projects and sick of [the time cost of refinement/triage](https://xkcd.com/1445):

## Notes

The main calculation is done by the `priority` function in [`prioritise.py`](./prioritise.py). In summary:

- we assume you use `pN-label`s (e.g. `p0-critical`, `p1-important`, `p2-nice-to-have`) on issues/PRs
  + labels match the [Python regex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) `[pP](?:riority)[\s:-]*([0-9]+).*`
- `bug` and `external-request` labels are treated the same as `p1`
- issues/PRs lacking a `pN-label` are treated as `p0`
  + this bumps unnoticed/unlabelled items to the top of the list, thus encouraging you to at least assign a `pN-label` to (potentially) lower the priority
- if an issue/PR has multiple labels, their associated priorities will be summed
- use `multiplier_labels` to exclude (e.g. `wip:-1` will skip anything labelled `wip`) or scale (e.g. `upstream:0.01`) the overall priority of an issue/PR
- labels not matching the above rules are ignored

Results are posted in a [job summary](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary). To post to your team's slack channel too:

- provide a `slack_webhook`
- create a file named `people.json` in the working directory (see e.g. https://status.cml.dev/people.json) to map GitHub usernames to Slack member IDs
